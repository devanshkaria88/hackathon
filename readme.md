# About 1Trade 

We’re building an AI-powered Web3 DApp that combines the strengths of Zora and Portia AI to create a dual experience: one for creators, and one for traders.

On the creator side, we’ll use AI to scan what’s trending on X — specific hashtags, topics, or even individual profiles like Elon or Trump. Based on user inputs (like frequency, content style, and theme preferences), the app will automatically generate an image related to that trend, and mint it as a Zora Coin using their protocol on Base. So basically, creators can auto-generate and launch their own trend-driven coins without touching a line of code.

On the trader side, we’ll have a Portia-powered AI agent that tracks market and social trends in real time, finds relevant Zora Coins, and evaluates their trading potential based on a user’s defined risk profile. The agent can then suggest trades or even execute them directly via Uniswap v3, depending on the user’s preferences.

The real power here is in combining cultural relevance with automated onchain execution — we’re turning trends into tokens and making trading decisions smarter through AI.

# 1Trade Web Platform

The 1Trade Web Platform is a web application that allows users to trade NFTs and other assets on the Zora blockchain. It dynamically fetches trending coins on zora platform and performs buy and sell transactions based on the market conditions, and its own strategy. Users can also determine how they want to influence the strategy by providing their input in plain english. It also analysis current twitter trends and after doing sentiment analysis on those trends, it can generate a new image that can be used to create a new coin on the platform.

## Future Plans

End to end implementation where 1Trade bot is integrated with 1Trade web platform along with AI workflow. This allows us to be in a unique position where we can create a new coin on the platform and also trade it.

# AI Workflow

The 1Trade AI workflow is a workflow that allows users to leverage use of AI to make trading easier and content generation even better. Users are given a space to create a prompt where they can describe what type of image they want to generate or just what style they want the image to be. Moreover, they can also select the type of image they want to generate, be it a coin or a creator image. For traders, our AI workflow integrates with Portia AI SDK to provide insights and recommendations based on market conditions and user input. This is leveraged by the 1Trade bot to provide insights and recommendations to users on what coins to trade in.

## Future Plans

Improving the AI workflow to provide more accurate insights and recommendations to users and intergrate with more blockchains.
